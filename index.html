            <summary><strong>Question: Explain Android Architecture in detail.</strong></summary>
            <p>
                <strong>Yt video-> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvwQal6WYJ0">Android Architecture</a></strong> <br><br>
                <strong>Answer:</strong><br><br>
                
                In Kotlin, Android architecture remains fundamentally the same as in Java, with slight differences in syntax and implementation. Here's a detailed explanation of Android architecture in the context of Kotlin:<br><br>
                
                1. <strong>Linux Kernel:</strong> The foundation of the Android architecture remains the Linux kernel, providing core system services like memory management, process management, and device driver support. Kotlin's interaction with the Linux kernel remains consistent with Java, as both languages compile down to bytecode that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which in turn interacts with the underlying Linux kernel.<br><br>
                
                2. <strong>Libraries:</strong> Kotlin-based Android applications utilize the same set of C/C++ libraries as Java-based applications. These libraries provide essential functionalities such as graphics rendering, multimedia processing, database management, and networking.<br><br>
                
                3. <strong>Android Runtime (ART):</strong> Kotlin applications on Android run on the Android Runtime (ART), similar to Java applications. ART compiles Kotlin bytecode into native machine code during installation or runtime, optimizing performance and reducing startup times. Kotlin's interoperability with Java allows it to seamlessly integrate with the Android Runtime and leverage its features.<br><br>
                
                4. <strong>Application Framework:</strong> Kotlin developers utilize the same Application Framework provided by Android to build their applications. This includes components such as Activity Manager, Content Providers, View System, Resource Manager, Notification Manager, and Activity Manager Service. Kotlin's concise syntax and powerful features enhance productivity and maintainability when working with these components.<br><br>
                
                - <strong>Activity Manager:</strong> Kotlin developers use activities to implement user interfaces and manage the application's lifecycle. Kotlin's language features, such as extension functions and higher-order functions, can simplify activity management and improve code readability.<br>
                
                - <strong>Content Providers:</strong> Kotlin's expressive syntax and null safety features make it easier to work with Content Providers, facilitating data sharing between applications and ensuring robust data access.<br>
                
                - <strong>View System:</strong> Kotlin's support for concise DSLs (Domain-Specific Languages) enables developers to create UI layouts declaratively, enhancing code readability and maintainability.<br>
                
                - <strong>Resource Manager:</strong> Kotlin's interoperability with XML-based resource files allows developers to define strings, layouts, graphics, and other resources in a clear and concise manner.<br>
                
                - <strong>Notification Manager:</strong> Kotlin's powerful language features, such as coroutines and extension functions, simplify the creation and management of notifications, improving the overall user experience.<br><br>
                
                By leveraging Kotlin's features and its seamless integration with the Android ecosystem, developers can build high-quality, performant, and maintainable Android applications that adhere to the principles of Android architecture.

            <summary><strong>Question: Explain Alert Dialog with example.</strong></summary>
            <p>
                <strong>Answer:</strong><br><br>
        
                An AlertDialog is a dialog window used to prompt the user for a decision or to display information. It typically interrupts the user's interaction with the app until a response is provided. Here's how to create and display an AlertDialog in Android using Kotlin:<br><br>
        
                <pre><code class="language-kotlin">// Create an AlertDialog.Builder object
        val alertDialogBuilder = AlertDialog.Builder(context)
        
        // Set the dialog title and message
        alertDialogBuilder.setTitle("Alert Dialog Example")
        alertDialogBuilder.setMessage("This is an example of an Alert Dialog.")
        
        // Set a positive button with a listener
        alertDialogBuilder.setPositiveButton("OK") { dialog, which ->
            // Code to execute when the OK button is clicked
            // For example, dismiss the dialog
            dialog.dismiss()
        }
        
        // Create the AlertDialog
        val alertDialog = alertDialogBuilder.create()
        
        // Show the AlertDialog
        alertDialog.show()</code></pre>
        
                In this example:<br>
                - We create an AlertDialog.Builder object.<br>
                - Set the title and message of the dialog using setTitle() and setMessage() methods, respectively.<br>
                - Define a positive button labeled "OK" using setPositiveButton(), along with a click listener to handle button clicks.<br>
                - Finally, we create the AlertDialog using create() and display it with show().<br><br>
        
                This AlertDialog will display a title, a message, and an "OK" button. Clicking the "OK" button will dismiss the dialog.

            <summary><strong>Question: What is Layout? Explain RelativeLayout in detail.</strong></summary>
            <p>
                <strong>Answer:</strong><br><br>
        
                In Android, a layout defines the visual structure for a user interface, organizing UI components such as buttons, text fields, and images. Layouts help to achieve a consistent and organized appearance across different devices and screen sizes. One commonly used layout in Android is the RelativeLayout.<br><br>
        
                <strong>RelativeLayout:</strong><br>
                RelativeLayout arranges UI components relative to each other or to the parent layout. This allows for flexible positioning of UI elements without the need for nested layouts. Here's an explanation of RelativeLayout with an example:<br><br>
        
                <pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
        &lt;RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent">
        
            &lt;Button
                android:id="@+id/button1"
                android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:text="Button 1"
                android:layout_alignParentTop="true"
                android:layout_alignParentStart="true"/>
        
            &lt;Button
                android:id="@+id/button2"
                android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:text="Button 2"
                android:layout_below="@id/button1"
                android:layout_alignParentStart="true"/>
        
            &lt;Button
                android:id="@+id/button3"
                android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:text="Button 3"
                android:layout_below="@id/button2"
                android:layout_alignParentStart="true"/>
        
        &lt;/RelativeLayout></code></pre>
        
                In this example:
                - We define a RelativeLayout as the parent layout.
                - Three buttons are placed one below the other using the <code>layout_below</code> attribute, with the first button aligned to the top of the parent using <code>layout_alignParentTop</code>.
                - Each button is positioned relative to the previous button, allowing for dynamic layout adjustments based on screen size and content.<br><br>
        
                RelativeLayout offers flexibility and ease of use in arranging UI components in Android applications.

    <summary><strong>Question: Create student database using SQLite with example.</strong></summary>
    <p>
        <strong>Answer:</strong><br><br>

        SQLite is a lightweight relational database management system widely used in Android applications for storing structured data. Here's an example of how to create a student database using SQLite in Android:<br><br>

        <pre><code class="language-kotlin">// Define the database helper class
class StudentDatabaseHelper(context: Context) : SQLiteOpenHelper(context, DATABASE_NAME, null, DATABASE_VERSION) {

    companion object {
        private const val DATABASE_VERSION = 1
        private const val DATABASE_NAME = "StudentDatabase"
        private const val TABLE_STUDENTS = "students"
        private const val KEY_ID = "id"
        private const val KEY_NAME = "name"
        private const val KEY_ROLL_NUMBER = "roll_number"
    }

    override fun onCreate(db: SQLiteDatabase) {
        // Create table query
        val createTableQuery = ("CREATE TABLE $TABLE_STUDENTS("
                + "$KEY_ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,"
                + "$KEY_NAME TEXT,"
                + "$KEY_ROLL_NUMBER TEXT)")

        // Execute the query
        db.execSQL(createTableQuery)
    }

    override fun onUpgrade(db: SQLiteDatabase, oldVersion: Int, newVersion: Int) {
        // Drop older table if exists and create a new one
        db.execSQL("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS $TABLE_STUDENTS")
        onCreate(db)
    }

    // Function to add a new student to the database
    fun addStudent(student: Student) {
        val db = this.writableDatabase
        val values = ContentValues()
        values.put(KEY_NAME, student.name)
        values.put(KEY_ROLL_NUMBER, student.rollNumber)

        // Insert row
        db.insert(TABLE_STUDENTS, null, values)
        db.close() // Close database connection
    }

    // Function to retrieve all students from the database
    fun getAllStudents(): List<Student> {
        val studentList = mutableListOf<Student>()
        val selectQuery = "SELECT * FROM $TABLE_STUDENTS"
        val db = this.readableDatabase
        val cursor = db.rawQuery(selectQuery, null)

        // Loop through all rows and add to list
        if (cursor.moveToFirst()) {
            do {
                val student = Student()
                student.id = cursor.getInt(cursor.getColumnIndex(KEY_ID))
                student.name = cursor.getString(cursor.getColumnIndex(KEY_NAME))
                student.rollNumber = cursor.getString(cursor.getColumnIndex(KEY_ROLL_NUMBER))
                studentList.add(student)
            } while (cursor.moveToNext())
        }
        cursor.close()
        db.close()
        return studentList
    }
}

// Define the Student class
data class Student(var id: Int = -1, var name: String = "", var rollNumber: String = "")</code></pre>

        In this example:
        - We define a <code>StudentDatabaseHelper</code> class that extends <code>SQLiteOpenHelper</code> to manage database creation and version management.
        - We define database constants such as database name, version, table name, and column names.
        - We implement <code>onCreate()</code> and <code>onUpgrade()</code> methods to create and upgrade the database schema.
        - We define functions to add a new student and retrieve all students from the database.

        You can use this example to create and manage a student database in your Android application using SQLite.

            <summary><strong>Question: Difference between Internal Storage and External Storage.</strong></summary>
            <p>
                <strong>Answer:</strong><br><br>
        
                Internal storage and external storage are two different storage options available on Android devices, each with its own characteristics and use cases:<br><br>
        
                <strong>Internal Storage:</strong><br>
                - Internal storage refers to the storage space that is part of the device's built-in memory.
                - It is private to the application and inaccessible to other applications.
                - Data stored in internal storage is deleted when the application is uninstalled.
                - Internal storage is typically used to store sensitive user data, configuration files, and cached data.
                - Access to internal storage is faster compared to external storage due to its direct integration with the device's memory.
                - Example: Storing user preferences, databases, and application-specific files.<br><br>
        
                <strong>External Storage:</strong><br>
                - External storage refers to removable storage media such as SD cards or USB drives that can be connected to the device.
                - It provides a shared storage space accessible to multiple applications and users.
                - Data stored in external storage persists even if the application is uninstalled.
                - External storage is suitable for storing large files, media files, and files that need to be shared across applications.
                - Access to external storage may be slower compared to internal storage due to the physical limitations of removable media.
                - Example: Storing multimedia files, downloaded files, and documents that need to be accessed by multiple applications.<br><br>
        
                In summary, internal storage is ideal for storing private application data and settings, while external storage is suitable for storing larger files and data that need to be shared between applications or persisted across application installations.

            <summary><strong>Question: Create an Android application that provides your cell details like (IMEI, SIM Number, and Operator Name etc.).</strong></summary>
            <p>
                <strong>Answer:</strong><br><br>
        
                To create an Android application that provides cell details such as IMEI, SIM number, and operator name, you can use the TelephonyManager class in Android. Here's an example of how to retrieve these details in an Android application:<br><br>
        
                <strong>Step 1: Add Permissions to Manifest File</strong><br>
                Ensure that the necessary permissions are added to the AndroidManifest.xml file:<br><br>
                <pre><code>&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" /></code></pre><br>
        
                <strong>Step 2: Retrieve Cell Details in Activity</strong><br>
                In your activity, use the TelephonyManager class to retrieve cell details:<br><br>
                <pre><code>import android.content.Context
        import android.os.Bundle
        import android.telephony.TelephonyManager
        import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
        import kotlinx.android.synthetic.main.activity_main.*
        
        class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
        
            override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
                super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
                setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
        
                val telephonyManager = getSystemService(Context.TELEPHONY_SERVICE) as TelephonyManager
        
                val imei = telephonyManager.imei
                val simSerialNumber = telephonyManager.simSerialNumber
                val operatorName = telephonyManager.networkOperatorName
        
                textViewIMEI.text = "IMEI: $imei"
                textViewSimNumber.text = "SIM Number: $simSerialNumber"
                textViewOperator.text = "Operator Name: $operatorName"
            }
        }</code></pre><br>
        
                <strong>Step 3: Layout File (activity_main.xml)</strong><br>
                Design your layout file to display the retrieved cell details:<br><br>
                <pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
        &lt;LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
            xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent"
            android:orientation="vertical"
            android:padding="16dp"
            tools:context=".MainActivity">
        
            &lt;TextView
                android:id="@+id/textViewIMEI"
                android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:textSize="18sp"
                android:textColor="@android:color/black"/>
        
            &lt;TextView
                android:id="@+id/textViewSimNumber"
                android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:textSize="18sp"
                android:textColor="@android:color/black"/>
        
            &lt;TextView
                android:id="@+id/textViewOperator"
                android:layout_width="wrap_content"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                android:textSize="18sp"
                android:textColor="@android:color/black"/>
        
        &lt;/LinearLayout></code></pre><br>
        
                This application retrieves the IMEI, SIM number, and operator name and displays them in a simple layout.

            <summary><strong>Question: Explain activity life cycle.</strong></summary>
            <p>
                <strong>Answer:</strong><br><br>
        
                The activity lifecycle in Android refers to the sequence of states that an activity goes through during its lifetime. These states include:<br><br>
        
                1. <strong>onCreate():</strong> Activity is created. This method is called when the activity is first created. It's typically used for initializing essential components of the activity, such as layout inflation and initialization of variables.<br><br>
        
                2. <strong>onStart():</strong> Activity becomes visible to the user. This method is called when the activity is becoming visible to the user but is not yet in the foreground. It's often used to perform tasks like registering broadcast receivers or initializing UI components.<br><br>
        
                3. <strong>onResume():</strong> Activity is in the foreground and ready to interact with the user. This method is called when the activity is about to start interacting with the user. It's used to start animations, acquire exclusive resources, or resume operations that were paused during onPause().<br><br>
        
                4. <strong>onPause():</strong> Another activity is in the foreground, but the activity is still visible to the user. This method is called when the activity is going into the background, but it's still visible to the user. It's used to pause ongoing operations that should not continue while the activity is not in focus, such as animations or sensor data updates.<br><br>
        
                5. <strong>onStop():</strong> Activity is no longer visible to the user. This method is called when the activity is no longer visible to the user. It's used to release resources that are no longer needed while the activity is not visible, such as stopping animations or releasing system resources.<br><br>
        
                6. <strong>onDestroy():</strong> Activity is being destroyed. This method is called when the activity is being destroyed. It's used to perform final cleanup, such as releasing resources, unregistering listeners, or saving persistent state data.<br><br>
        
                These lifecycle methods allow developers to manage the behavior of their activities and handle events such as configuration changes, user interruptions, and application navigation.

            <summary><strong>Question: Explain SQLite Database in Android.</strong></summary>
            <p>
                <strong>Answer:</strong><br><br>
        
                SQLite is a lightweight relational database management system used in Android applications to store and retrieve structured data locally. It is embedded into the Android framework and provides a simple and efficient way to manage databases directly on the device. Here's an overview of SQLite Database in Android:<br><br>
        
                <strong>Features of SQLite Database:</strong>
                - Lightweight: SQLite is designed to be lightweight and self-contained, making it suitable for embedded systems and mobile devices.
                - Relational: SQLite supports relational database features such as tables, rows, columns, indexes, and foreign keys.
                - ACID Compliance: SQLite ensures Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID) properties for transactions, ensuring data integrity and reliability.
                - Zero Configuration: SQLite requires minimal setup and configuration, as it doesn't require a separate server process or administration.
                - Cross-Platform: SQLite databases can be easily transferred across different platforms and architectures, ensuring compatibility and portability.<br><br>
        
                <strong>Using SQLite in Android:</strong>
                - To use SQLite in Android, developers interact with the SQLiteDatabase class provided by the Android framework. This class provides methods for creating, opening, querying, and manipulating databases.
                - Developers can create SQLite databases directly in the application's private internal storage or use an existing SQLite database stored in the assets folder.
                - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) can be performed on SQLite databases using SQL queries or convenience methods provided by SQLiteDatabase class.<br><br>
        
                <strong>Creating and Managing SQLite Databases:</strong>
                - To create and manage SQLite databases, developers typically subclass SQLiteOpenHelper class. This class provides methods for creating and upgrading databases, as well as accessing SQLiteDatabase instances.
                - Developers define database schema (tables, columns, constraints) using Data Definition Language (DDL) SQL statements in the onCreate() method of SQLiteOpenHelper.
                - SQLiteOpenHelper also provides the onUpgrade() method to handle database version upgrades and schema changes, ensuring data migration and compatibility.<br><br>
        
                SQLite Database in Android provides developers with a powerful and efficient way to store and manage structured data locally, enabling offline functionality, data persistence, and efficient data access.

            <summary><strong>Question: What is Shared Preferences? Explain methods for create, search, read, add, update, and delete shared preferences.</strong></summary>
            <p>
                <strong>Answer:</strong><br><br>
        
                Shared Preferences in Android is a simple key-value storage system that allows applications to store and retrieve primitive data types in the form of key-value pairs. It is commonly used for storing small amounts of data such as user preferences, settings, and application state.<br><br>
        
                <strong>Methods for Shared Preferences:</strong><br><br>
        
                <strong>1. Create Shared Preferences:</strong><br>
                To create a new Shared Preferences file or access an existing one, you typically use the getSharedPreferences() method, passing in a unique name for the preferences file and a mode indicating the file's accessibility mode.<br><br>
        
                ```kotlin
                val sharedPreferences = getSharedPreferences("MyPreferences", Context.MODE_PRIVATE)
                ```<br><br>
        
                <strong>2. Search for a Key:</strong><br>
                To check if a key exists in the Shared Preferences file, you can use the contains() method.<br><br>
        
                ```kotlin
                val keyExists = sharedPreferences.contains("key")
                ```<br><br>
        
                <strong>3. Read Value:</strong><br>
                To retrieve a value associated with a key from Shared Preferences, you can use getter methods such as getInt(), getFloat(), getLong(), getBoolean(), or getString().<br><br>
        
                ```kotlin
                val value = sharedPreferences.getString("key", defaultValue)
                ```<br><br>
        
                <strong>4. Add or Update Value:</strong><br>
                To add or update a value in Shared Preferences, you use editor methods such as putInt(), putFloat(), putLong(), putBoolean(), or putString(), followed by apply() or commit() to persist the changes.<br><br>
        
                ```kotlin
                val editor = sharedPreferences.edit()
                editor.putString("key", "value")
                editor.apply() // or editor.commit()
                ```<br><br>
        
                <strong>5. Delete Value:</strong><br>
                To remove a value associated with a key from Shared Preferences, you can use the remove() method, followed by apply() or commit().<br><br>
        
                ```kotlin
                val editor = sharedPreferences.edit()
                editor.remove("key")
                editor.apply() // or editor.commit()
                ```<br><br>
        
                These methods allow developers to easily manage data stored in Shared Preferences, providing a convenient way to store and retrieve application settings and user preferences.
